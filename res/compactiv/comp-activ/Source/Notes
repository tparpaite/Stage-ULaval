compActiv Database

The compActiv databases is a collection of a computer
systems activity measures . The data was collected from a
Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in
a multi-user university department. Users would typically be
doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the
internet, editing files or running very cpu-bound
programs. The data was collected continuously on two
separate occasions. On both occassions, system activity was
gathered every 5 seconds. The final dataset is taken from
both occasions with equal numbers of observations coming
from each collection epoch.

System measures used:

   1.lread - Reads (transfers per second ) between system memory and user memory 
   2.lwrite - writes (transfers per second) between system memory and user memory 
   3.scall - Number of system calls of all types per second 
   4.sread - Number of system read calls per second . 
   5.swrite - Number of system write calls per second . 
   6.fork - Number of system fork calls per second. 
   7.exec - Number of system exec calls per second. 
   8.rchar - Number of characters transferred per second by system read calls 
   9.wchar - Number of characters transfreed per second by system write calls 
  10.pgout - Number of page out requests per second 
  11.ppgout - Number of pages, paged out per second 
  12.pgfree - Number of pages per second placed on the free list. 
  13.pgscan - Number of pages checked if they can be freed per second 
  14.atch - Number of page attaches (satisfying a page fault by reclaiming a page in memory) per
     second 
  15.pgin - Number of page-in requests per second 
  16.ppgin - Number of pages paged in per second 
  17.pflt - Number of page faults caused by protection errors (copy-on-writes). 
  18.vflt - Number of page faults caused by address translation . 
  19.runqsz - Process run queue size 
  20.freemem - Number of memory pages available to user processes 
  21.freeswap - Number of disk blocks available for page swapping. 
  22.usr - Portion of time (%) that cpus run in user mode 
  23.sys - Portion of time (%) that cpus run in system mode 
  24.wio - Portion of time (%) that cpus are idle waiting for block IO 
  25.idle - Portion of time (%) that cpus are otherwise idle 

Prototasks

cpu 
     Predict usr, portion of time, that cpus run in user
     mode from all attributes 1-21.

cpuSmall 
     Predict usr using a restricted number (excluding the
     paging information (10-18)


How the data was collected
==========================

Data was collected on 2 different occassions using the sar
program (cpu.4096.gz and cpu.8096.gz) Both occassions
included the 12:00-18:00 which is when the machines would be
busiest. The scripts gen and genRaw were used to extract the
chosen fileds from the raw data. 4096 data points were
randomly chosen from each files to make the 8192 data
points. The final dataset was a random permutation of the
8192 samples.
